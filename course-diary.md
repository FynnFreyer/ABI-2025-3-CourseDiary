# Notes about Git

We have both local and remote repositories.
A repository consists of working directory, staging area and the repository proper.

## Commands

- `git status` -- shows changes to the working directory and the state of the staging area
- `git add` -- add changes to a file to the staging area
- `git commit` -- bundle the staged changes and commit them to the repository
- `git push` -- synchronize changes (commits) **to** the remote
- `git pull` -- synchronize changes (commits) **from** the remote

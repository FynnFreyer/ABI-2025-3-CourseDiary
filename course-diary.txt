Notes about Git

We have both local and remote repositories.
A repository consists of working directory, staging area and the repository proper.

COMMANDS

git status
shows changes to the working directory and the state of the staging area

git add
add changes to a file to the staging area

git commit
bundle the staged changes and commit them to the repository
